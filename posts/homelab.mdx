My custom-built NAS running Unraid hosts the following services.

![NAS](/images/homelab/nas.webp)

* Jellyfin: Media library
* Kavita: Ebooks and manga
* AdGuard Home: Ad blocking
* Nginx: Reverse proxy
* Borgmatic: Configuration-driven backup software

AppData and important shares such Pictures are backuped via borgmatic to Borgbase

Replaced the rear fan with a Nocuta NF-A12x15 that is much quieter.

For remote access, I connect to the machine via VPN. I back up my MacBook to that machine with Time Machine, and I back up my desktop and VPS to it using rsync.

Cheap Ionos VPS running nixos via nixos-infect for services exposed to the internet. Mainly using it for hosting this website and Nextcloud.
